 We plan to create an app that allows UCSC students to maximize their flexi-dollars and meals
 by tracking their funds and building cost-effective meals in the app. The app should feature
 the menus of all or most on-campus eateries, with the exception of the dining halls, which
 already have numerous apps. The app should feature a “balance” that tracks the user’s funds,
 and functions that automatically decrement these funds once a meal is built.
